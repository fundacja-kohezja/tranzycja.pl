# Guide for transgender people from Ukraine

:::info
[PL: Tekst w języku polskim](https://tranzycja.pl/publikacje/osoby-transplciowe-ukraina/) | [UKR: текст українською мовою](https://tranzycja.pl/en/publications/transhenderni-lyudy-ukrayiny/)
:::

This is a guide for transgender people from Ukraine, which will provide them with information on how to safely escape Ukraine and settle in Poland for time being (if that is the country to which you’ve managed to escape to).  In the future we hope that we will be able to provide additional information regarding the situation in other countries you would prefer to settle in. 

We know that the Internet is full of various contacts and offers of help, sometimes numerous enough to paralyze and sometimes simply not reachable at the moment or outdated. We aim to provide you with links only to trusted, long term operating organizations with experience of helping LGBTQ+ people in Ukraine and explain your situation using the most relevant information available. The following guide was prepared by transgender refugee activist from tranzycja.pl (Polish database about all things transgender) and Grupa Granica (coalition of most important Polish refugee NGOs) based on amazing work and up-to-date knowledge of activists from @lgbtukrainebot helping directly transgender people in Ukraine and connected to both Ukrainian and European LGBTQ+ organizations.

## I want to escape from Ukraine

People who can help you in planning that are available 24/7 via Telegram chatbot @lgbtukrainebot.

:::danger

Please remember that Telegram is not encrypted. When you share sensitive data, turn on secret chat.

:::

It is important to stay in contact with them and inform them of every step in the journey in case anything goes wrong - they are well connected with other organizations and can come up with solutions.

**However there are also things you can prepare beforehand to shorten intervention time.** Prepare all your documents and diagnoses, expect you will have to discuss your medical and legal history with people in the chat. They are also LGBTQ and they need this information in order to help you the best they can. Do not forget to mention your additional medical needs or disabilities.

If you are in the city in the front line or in dangerous living situation outside front line:
* check the Telegram channel of Ukrainian railroads https://t.me/UkrzalInfo. It is the best you travel first to queer shelters in the cities in the West of Ukraine. People at the chatbox will give you the address details. Remember that it is the best not to travel alone - if that’s possible tag to a group of your LGBTQ friends or even cis women. Remember to dress as feminine as possible, do not speak a lot, keep your mask on at all times. Queues can be very long so it is best to bring food, warm clothes or even sleeping bags. Train journey itself is described by people who escaped as calm, with little police presence. 
* if your city has no railways, reach out to people at chatbox. It is not something anyone can promise, because such things are unpredictable, but they will search for LGBTQ friendly drivers in your area.

### Information related to the situation of native Ukrainians

:::spoiler If you are in a safe city and in a safe living situation but without F64 diagnosis

Stay where you are and keep people at chatbox updated if anything changes. As of now, there are no 100% safe solutions on how to escape and everything is solved on a case to case basis. Activists in Ukraine and the rest of Europe are working on more permanent solutions, but it is going to take time and a variety of attempts.

:::

:::spoiler If you have F64 diagnosis and want to leave Ukraine as soon as possible.

You will have to go to Voyenkomat. It is an option associated with some risks, but activists are working on ways to mitigate them. You won’t be alone there and activists are able to support you through it. From your side, remember to collect as many medical documents as possible. The rule is “the more stamps, the better”. Remember about your additional illnesses - if you have any, including mental disorders, it is good to also collect such papers to show at Voyenkomat.

:::

:::spoiler If you don’t have F64 diagnosis, but want to leave as soon as possible.
a.) your situation needs to be analyzed carefully by activists from the chatbox. Things will be harder, but it doesn’t mean it’s impossible. We are all still working on new solutions and ways to help.

:::

:::spoiler How does visit at Voyenkomat looks like?

Voyenkomat is open from 9AM, however, due to queues, it is important to be there earlier. Bring warm clothes and food if possible. Personal belongings will be checked so don’t bring anything potentially dangerous. There can be from one up to three lines (first for registration, second for medical commission and third for lawyer). Activists will try to do their best to make this process as safe as possible for you. At registration you must insist upon seeing a Military Medical Commission - people should get you a referral. At the Commission, when asked about disability or other diagnoses, you must tell them you have a psychiatric diagnosis and you should be further referred to a psychiatrist. Bring every document you have that proves your diagnosis. If everything goes well, you will receive category A, exempt from military service. Then you’ll need to present papers from a psychiatrist in the office of chief physician. Unfortunately the queue can last for days there. You need to ask for a date at which you can return and get your full documents.

### Information for non-Ukrainians

You are exempt from military service, however you can still encounter some issues during your travel, especially if you are a person of color. You should be able to find answers to your questions and support contact on the [webpage of Grupa Granica](https://ukraina.grupagranica.pl/non-ukrainians).

### Information on border crossings

Regardless of the country you choose to flee to, prepare for long queues. You can wait anywhere from 6 to 24 hours, so prepare for the cold. It can be very hard to get to the bathroom so try to limit your food and water intake while maintaining regard for your own health and safety. Activists from chatbox will advise you what country is currently the best to choose to escape to. 

Grupa Granica has [a separate site](https://ukraina.grupagranica.pl/granica) where they provide information on the current situation at Polish border crossings.


[Grupa Granica main site](https://ukraina.grupagranica.pl) showcases a variety of information regarding your legal status as an Ukrainian refugee in Poland and it is worth exploring. It also has contact information if you need any additional support. If you need more detailed information on matters relating to refugee law, team of Stowarzyszenie Interwencji Prawnej, legal NGO and part of Grupa Granica prepared [specialized portal](https://ukraina.interwencjaprawna.pl/uk/) delving into in-depth legal issues.

## I have escaped, I’m in Poland right now and...


### ...I don’t have a place to live
There are LGBTQ organizations in practically every bigger city in Poland and all of them are trans-friendly. The same is true for NGOs dedicated to helping refugees, however the accomodation they provide may not always be fully safe for you as a transgender person. 

:::info

Right now, it is the easiest to obtain help in Warszawa and Poznań. 

:::

If you are **in Warsaw, you can go to Lambda’s Support Centre for Ukrainian LGBTQ+ Refugees** at Żurawia 24a lok. 4 00-515 Warsaw, Poland. It is open every day from 9 AM to 9 PM. There you can  receive more information about forms of help available for you. To access it you must be vaccinated against COVID-19, you won’t be let inside otherwise You should also fill an [online questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLNHWeeuIwfHVTyknQQchJN9tiFUEMSILmUTOJB2pHXU5sMQ/viewform?fbclid=IwAR3H1VPIFQWAQmUtfizvgFxz51-1ExGm31a_x2ZKFdzc9AGUt1EeVNG8pOM) detailing your needs before your visit.

* Znaki Równości - Cracow - kontakt@znakirownosci.org.pl
* Kultura Równości - Wrocław -  kontakt@kulturarownosci.org
 
### ...need hormones or have other medical needs


Due to transphobia and disorganization of the Polish healthcare system, obtaining access to HRT can unfortunately come with some obstacles. 
If you are already in a secure location in Poland, you should ask people from the organization that helped you with housing. They should help you get your hormones refill. Technically, Ukrainian refugees are eligible for free healthcare and should be able to easily obtain prescriptions for free, especially in cases of taking medicine on a permanent basis. By law, [pharmacist should be obliged to refill your prescription](https://queer.pl/artykul/206248/transgendernim-bzencjam-z-ukrani-u-polszcz-mozna-podati-zajawku-na-gormonaln-preparati), but we know of cases of refusals. 

* If you need F.64 diagnosis or psychiatric diagnosis with trans friendly doctor write to: ukraina@grupa-stonewall.pl

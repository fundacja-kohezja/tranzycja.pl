# Welcome to **tranzycja.pl**!

Our project is Poland's largest publicly available knowledge base on transgender people and on all things trans-related. In the absence of any legal regulations on gender transition, as well as lack of reliable education among the medical community, the primary source of knowledge for trans people is the Internet. Our project was founded in 2021 in response to the lack of active Polish sources providing scientifically grounded trans-related content, presented in a way that does not replicate media narratives of suffering or illness, but instead rooted in the idea of celebrating our identities and the trans liberation.

This project is carried out by passionate activists with a support of [![Stowarzyszenia Grupa Stonewall](/media/img/logo/STOn_logo_transparent-pink.svg){.h-8 .inline}](https://grupa-stonewall.pl/en/){.border-b-0} and [Fundacja Kohezja](https://kohezja.org), but it could not exist without people like you. **If you believe transgender people should have access to knowledge, and you appreciate our work, please consider supporting us so we can continue creating educational content for our community.**

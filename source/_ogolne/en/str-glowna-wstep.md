# Welcome to the website of the **tranzycja.pl** project!

Our project is Poland's largest publicly available knowledge base on transgender people and on the process of transitioning. In the absence of any legal regulations on gender transition, as well as the lack of reliable education among the medical community, the primary source of knowledge for trans people is the Internet. Our project was founded in 2021 in response to the lack of active sources providing scientifically grounded content related to trans people, presented in a way that does not replicate media narratives of suffering or illness, but instead rooted in the idea of celebrating our identities and the trans liberation.

The project is supported by [![Stowarzyszenia Grupa Stonewall](/media/img/logo/STOn_logo_transparent-pink.svg){.h-8 .inline}](https://grupa-stonewall.pl){.border-b-0} and [Fundation Kohezja](https://kohezja.org), but it could not exist without people like you. If our work is helpful to you, please help us, so that we can continue to grow and create more content - [support us!](/en/support)

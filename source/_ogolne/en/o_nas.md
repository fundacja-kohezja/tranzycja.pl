Tranzycja.pl is a collaborative knowledge base centred around the website of the same name. Its main focus is the education and awareness raising inside of the trans community. Our work is grounded in the values of evidence-based medicine, intersectional feminism and trans liberation. The core of our team is made up almost entirely with transgender people and includes experienced self-advocates, a physician, a psychologist and a medical technician.

Our accomplishments include:
- over 20 detailed guides describing various aspects of transition, including hormone therapy regimens, top surgery techniques and complicated procedure of changing legal gender marker. Our articles combine the evidence-based approach with comprehensible form and practical advice regarding the practicalities of Polish healthcare.
- essays and interviews covering different experiences of transition, aiming to provide gender-questioning persons with the knowledge required to envision their future 
- training and courses services for medical professionals provided by interdisciplinary team including both experienced self-advocates and healthcare providers with experience in treating transgender patients. 
- a complex guide for General Practictioners regarding transgender care
- a first raport dedicated to the Gender Identity Change Efforts (GICE) in Polish, detailing its history, modern forms and legal status
- facilitating political change both through the education of our own community about trans liberatory models of healthcare and through critical engagement with the medical professionals.
- 15 thousand unique visitors monthly, representing the trust we have earned in the Polish trans community as a primary medical source.

Our plans include further development of the project - new functionalities that facilitate easier access to knowledge, such as an interactive map of transfriendly healthcare professionals, translation of our most important materials to the other languages (especially to Ukrainian because of the Russian aggression on our neighbor's territory). We are also working on creating a trans studies section of our website, dedicated both to translation of the transfeminist classics and to providing space for Polish theorists and authors.

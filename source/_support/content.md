# Create content!

Tranzycja.pl is a bottom-up knowledge base on transgender and transsexuality - any person who wants to get involved in its development has the opportunity to do so, whether by submitting a single text or actively engaging in other work of the project. Our team is open to new people and we operate on an equal footing, including working on issues not directly related to content creation.

We publish articles on any topic related to transgender and transsexual people. Since the content is prepared by different people, we have developed a set of recommendations and guidelines, through which we try to maintain a consistently high level of the materials created.

Depending on the form and subject of the text, it can go into 3 different categories:
- articles providing general information on transgenderism and transition (section **Step by Step** and some texts from the **Publications** section).
- personal articles, interviews, essays, testimonies, translations, personal descriptions of experiences (section **Publications**)
- short informational forms, texts related to current events/situations, information on the development of the project (section **News**)

## 1. General information

:::spoiler 1. Submitted materials do not have to be perfect, but the better you prepare them, the easier it will be for us to publish them.

You also don't have to single-handedly pore over a big text right away. To begin with, you can describe something about which you already know a lot, have your own experience, but also have gathered reliable information. Larger texts can be written in teams. Each text before publication is also read by other team members, who will suggest corrections to you as part of substantive and stylistic correction. However, if the material deviates very strongly from the standards adopted by the group, due to lack of resources to thoroughly rewrite each text submitted, we may unfortunately be forced to refuse publication.

:::

:::spoiler 2. If you don't know what topic to write about, you can take a look at our [notebook with topic ideas](https://hackmd.io/hHZLDrbcQ962NCrut5u5hA?view).

Remember, too, that we are committed to providing comprehensive information on every topic described. If you see that any of our articles needs to be updated or supplemented, you can suggest corrections on its page in the [HackMD] (https://hackmd.io/team/tranzycja?nav=overview).

:::

:::spoiler 3. Care should be taken to ensure that the text is properly structured.

It's still worth paying attention at the planning stage to what elements our content consists of (sub-headings, tables, highlight blocks, lists, etc.), so that later you don't have to rebuild the structure of the entire text. If you don't know how to use Markdown tags, you don't have to worry about it. You can use a graphical editor and refer to [tutorial](https://hackmd.io/4rlK9xcGRVidPifBv3EFvg). However, if your text will be prepared in another format, we can handle it too, provided it has the right structure.

:::info
It may be helpful here to review other articles from the section in which you want to publish so that you can see by example what style you are targeting and how they are formatted and edited.
:::

:::spoiler  4. In the tranzycja.pl team we are guided by the principles of intersectional feminism

We will not publish content that supports sexism, homophobia, transphobia, or any other form of exclusion of oppressed groups.

:::

## 2. Publications and guides under the brand tranzycja.pl

:::spoiler 1.  All medical information contained in the article must have a reliable source.

You can use tools such as SciHub or Library Genesis to access scientific sources. We do not spread myths, misinformation, or hearsay information - the exception being topics where scientific data has not been collected at this point. In that case, anecdotal data can be included, with a clear indication that there is no certainty about it.

:::
 

:::spoiler  2. The style of the article should be concise, professional and understandable.

We do not repeat the same information several times, do not write in colloquial language, but also do not go into hard-to-understand scientific details if it is not absolutely necessary. Sometimes we may use a lighter tone or make a joke, but this should be done sparingly.

:::

:::spoiler 3. We do not create new texts on already described topics.

An emerging article may be an expansion of an aspect already covered somewhere on the site, but publishing new text rather than updating existing text must have a compelling justification, such as site readability. It should also be significantly more elaborate and informative, and related material should be supplemented with relevant references.

:::

:::spoiler 4. We try to ensure that each article completely exhausts its topic.

We do not limit the length of texts, but regardless of their length, each material must be formatted in such a way as to be clearly navigable, and provided with headings of the appropriate degree so as to be able to link to specific parts of it. When the test is particularly extensive or touches on a few different aspects, it can be divided into smaller articles.

:::

## 3. Personal, author publications

These texts can be much looser than the texts in the first category and do not have to meet such lofty categories.

:::spoiler 1. Published texts should be characterized by linguistic and stylistic correctness.

We try to make our texts friendly and accessible to readers. We avoid overly difficult or pretentious language, but we don't exaggerate in the other direction either. We maintain professionalism so that no text is sloppy or incomprehensible.

:::

:::spoiler 2. The text contains something interesting that we would like to convey to the community.

In your publication, you can convey hope, a new insight, a different perspective, or your experiences to the community. 

:::

:::spoiler 3. The material is informative rather than artistic.

Rather, we do not publish stories, poems, or reviews. We are not a cultural or gossip portal. We are also not in the business of commenting on current events, unless they are of particular importance to the community.

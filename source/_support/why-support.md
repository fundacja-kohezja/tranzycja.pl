# Why support us? (english)

## Who are we?

We are a group of people for whom the topics of transition and transgenderism are close. We are committed to supporting the Polish transgender community: we dispel myths, describe complicated procedures in an understandable way, and ultimately we would also like to strive for systemic changes in accordance with science and the needs of trans people.

Achieving these goals is inseparable from spreading the latest knowledge, encouraging experts to continuously educate themselves, and promoting the provision of high-quality, professional medical services to trans people, treating them with dignity, on an equal footing with other patients and clients.

The goal of our site is to collect all knowledge related to transgender: from transition, to transgender everyday life, to information on history or culture. We invite you to draw from and share your experiences - so the whole community benefits :)

Whether you're trans, trying to understand your gender, or supportive; a public service worker, civil servant, teacher, or someone looking for material for a research paper, you'll find a lot of helpful information here: in the form of articles, guides, and references to other sources.

## Why do we need support?

The information on our site is not and will never be hidden behind a paywall or otherwise paid for. In order not to hinder access to knowledge and for the sake of trust in our advice, we also do not place any ads or paid advertisements, and consequently, we have to cover all costs related to the maintenance and development of the project in other ways.

It takes a lot of time and hard work by a whole team of people to constantly provide new, high-quality material. Each text on our site is preceded by meticulous research of the topic, analysis of studies and reports, and consultation with experts. It is then edited, described with sources, revised and finally formatted. We also often prepare summaries in the form of infographics or social media boards.

Being aware of living in a capitalist system and the ever-increasing cost of living, we are aware that many people with valuable experience and skills cannot afford to devote themselves to unpaid activism. Moreover, we believe that the expectation of unpaid work out of the goodness of the heart is an expletive-laden practice that closes us off to a narrow group of privileged individuals who can afford such conditions. That's why, as part of our openness to new and valuable perspectives and our willingness to support people who already choose to make plenty of sacrifices on a daily basis, we try to make sure that the activities of our activists are rewarded to the extent that we can afford. As a result, the community gets a thriving project, with new materials appearing regularly, and everyone benefits - how many people we are able to support and engage is inseparable from how big a budget we manage to raise.

## Why do we ask individuals to contribute?

There are different ways to finance projects - each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses, and each money comes with a cost. Private businesses, when deciding to support a project, most often expect advertising, or buy themselves so-called "queerwashing" in this way. Then the cost on the project's side is always to some extent the image, and perhaps also the trust of the community. On the other hand, when accepting grants from government or non-governmental programs or foundations, we have to agree to various conditions and we take over their priorities to some extent, which over time can create situations in which we are unable to carry out the necessary activities for the community for many months, because instead we "maintain the project" by doing things that are important and necessary, but not necessarily the most important - we drift away from our original mission and miss our goals, which are replaced by imposed goals.

That's why it's so important to have a healthy budget balance and financial independence from outside entities - something you can help us with! The core of this project has always been, is and will always be the community. It is for her that we want to create and be accountable to her. While we won't be able to give up grants and business donations completely with her for the day, with your support we can reduce their share of our budget to such an extent that we can be comfortable and secure in the fact that it is our community that sets our goals and we work for them.

## Ongoing support works both ways

In order to build financial stability and independence from external entities, any declared cyclic contributions, including the smallest ones: 5-10 PLN, will be particularly helpful. We promise that any one-time payment of a larger amount will be used appropriately - we will use it to pay for the server, licenses for the tools we use, commission a single text to an independent author or graphics. However, something that one-time sums do not give is stability.

If you regularly visit our site - at least once or several times a month - consider declaring a recurring contribution. The equivalent of a single donation multiplied by the effect of scale can give us the next months of operation, the possibility to involve more people on a permanent basis, or start new activities and campaigns within the project. If our site is a real help to you - save time, effort, nerves - it is probably worth investing a small amount each month in its further development? :)

## What will we spend the collected money on?

- support of trans people involved in activism activities within our team
- developing the resources of our site, including the creation of an exhaustive list of standards-verified experts
- more multimedia: illustrations, infographics
- texts by independent authors (outside of our permanent team)
- further development of the website from the technical side - patching holes, adding functionality

Do you want to engage with the trans community, but can't afford it for financial reasons? Thanks to the people who support our project, we will be able to reward the activist work of people like you!

## Every person is welcome

We operate from the bottom up and have a flat structure, meaning that any person can join us and have as much influence on the development of the project as anyone else.

While the project's premise is to promote the exchange of experiences and knowledge in the trans community, we do not close ourselves off to people who want to support us with their knowledge and skills, as long as they do so with respect for the project's goals and priorities and the people in it.

In our team there are volunteers committing varying degrees of time, as well as individuals devoting much more time and receiving varying degrees of compensation. We would like to support all activists active in our group, but we need to remain flexible depending on our capabilities and the individual needs of different people. When expanding the team into more roles with financial support and commissioning outside artists and creators, we always try to involve people from the trans community first. We see this as another way of carrying out our mission to support the community. We are also aware that these are people from a social minority struggling more than most with financial problems, lack of employment, and sizable medical expenses. Therefore, every zloty donated to support our project, is also a zloty donated to support someone's transit or financially disadvantaged. So in a sense, by paying once, you are doing two good deeds - you are supporting an individual and at the same time the whole community!
